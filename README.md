# Book-Review_Sentiment_Analysis
This Project is a Machine learning-based implementation to detect the polarity of Book reviews. Dataset was collected from kaggle and modified to match our interests. Dataset is divided into two classes Positive and Negative. Several Machine Leaning Algorithms were implemented including Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes. We obtained the best result for SVM with 85% of accuracy.
